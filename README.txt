Cueto - Task 2 - Sample Code

Is a sample java-based code that i made for my current project; This covers a page of the system which is one big table.

Each field has a lot of validation and upon saving, there's even more validation that's why there's a lot of conditions on the IF statements.

Usually in the FOR/DO-WHILE loops, it checks if the cursor is already in the correct row. Hence, it doesn't follow the conventional middle condition. 


Reasons for not doing it in the amaysim:
1. I currently do not have any other automation installed. Since the "exam" was only given a 24hr period. I also could not install application without autorization.

2. The only tool i have is Oracle OpenScript - OATS. Unfortunately, it cannot handle HTML5 tags such as Input with "Type = tel".
